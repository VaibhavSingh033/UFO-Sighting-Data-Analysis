#UFO Sightings around the world

This data includes >80,000 recorded UFO "sightings" around the world, including the UFO shape, lat/long and state/country of where the sighting occurred, duration of the "event" and the data_time when it occurred.

Data comes originally from NUFORC, was cleaned and uploaded to Github by Sigmond Axel, and some exploratory plots were created by Jonathan Bouchet a few years back.

H/t to Georgios Karamanis for sharing the data as an issue on Github. If you want to submit a dataset of your own interest, please do so as an Issue on our GitHub! If you do submit a dataset, please drop a link and some context as an issue. Thanks!
